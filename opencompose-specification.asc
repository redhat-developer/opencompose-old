= OpenCompose Specification

# WIP : This document is under heavy modification.

# Introduction

This document lists and describes all elements of the proposed filespec for a standardised orchestration file aimed at developers. It also identifies
mappings to existing orchestration solutions such as Docker Compose, Kubernetes/OpenShift and Apache Mesos Marathon.

# Detailed Element Specification

#### version
Version of the specification used.

This directive is mandatory.
----
version: "0.1"
----


#### author
Author of the compose file.
----
author:
  name: Daisy Jones
  email: daisyjones@email.com
----


#### services
`services` is the main directive and is mandatory with one or more services defined.
----
version: "0.1"
services:
  web:
    ...
  db:
    ...
----


#### build
Builds a container image from given path or a context .

Either `build` or `image` directive has to exist in compose file or will result in error. If `image` directive is absent then a generated name is used for the resultant image.
----
build: ./src

build:
  context: ./src
----


#### context
Path to  directory containing a Dockerfile or url to Git repository. `context` is used as a sub-option to build.
----
build:
  context: git://mysource/repo/project.git
----


#### dockerfile
Alternate Dockerfile used for building an container image. Dockerfile is used as sub-option to build.
----
build:
  dockerfile: Other-Dockerfile

build:
  context: ./src
  dockerfile: Other-Dockerfile
----


#### image
The image from which the container will start. Needs to be any valid image specified in repository/tag or partial image ids.

Either `build` or `image` directive has to exist in compose file or will result in error.

If the specified image is not found on the system and `build` directive is absent, then it will be pulled from image repository. If `build` directive is present, then a new iimage will be built and given the name and tags as specified by `image` directive.
----
image: awesome-micro-service:v1

image: nginx
----


#### command
Command to override the default command in the container. Optionally a list of arguments can be provided.
----
  command: python setup.py

  command:
    -python
    - setup.py
    - register
----


#### container_name
Specify a custom container name, rather than a generated default name. This name should be unique within a namespace or else will result in error.
----
container_name: app-container
----


#### depends_on
*TODO*
----
----


#### environment
List of environment variables to be set in container. Overrides values listed in `env_file`
----
environment:
  - S3_BUCKET: SOME_S3_BUCKET
  - API_KEY: XYZABCDE123
  - API_SECRET:SFZV3EYT89
  - DATABASE_URL="postgres://SOME_URL"
----


#### env_file
Add environment variables listed in the file. Variables listed in `environment` override values listed here.
----
env_file: .env

env_file:
  - ./s3_paths.env
  - /aws_keys.env
----


#### expose
*TODO*
----
----


#### extends
*TODO*
----
----


#### hostpid
Use the host’s pid namespace. Defaults to false.
----

<1> Single port
<2> List of ports


#### volumes
A list of paths or named volumes which will be mounted and can be shared by resources.

----

----

Volumes can optionally provide a unique `volumeId` to define a named volume. Each named volume can have `type` parameter that defines the type of volume and a `options` parameter.

----
volumes :
  volumeId:data
    type: ebs
    options:
      fsType: ext4
      imageID:fobaar
  volumeId: shared-nfs-data
    type: nfs
